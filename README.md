### About
This script will take in a RGB image and apply 2 different
fire detection algorithms. The script will create 2 images(one
for each algorithm) and output them in the same directory as the input
image.

### Running the python Script

    python A2.py <Image File Path>

Example:

    python A2.py Images/fireplace.jpg

### Notes:
* Images can be most file types (ie. PNG, JPG, TIFF, etc)
* Libraries that must be updated:
    * numpy
    * PIL
    * imageIO
    * cv2
    (pip can be used to update these)
